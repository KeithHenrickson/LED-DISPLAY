This is our 16x16 RGB LED project. We will be selling these on our website, etsy page, and at
Retro shows.

The display comes pre-programmed with tons of retro sprites in static and animated forms. You
can take this code and make your own sprite display if you are so inclined.

On our website www.techdungeon.xyz you can find our latest binary we have released 
for the display.  You can use this to restore your display back to the "factory" settings you
got it from us. This is useful if you play around with it and want to restore it.

Any new updates to the code will be released here and new binaries with new art from us will
always be availble to people who have the display for free on our website. Be aware
if we come out with a new display product in the future with a higher resolution, that product
will have its own github page, and binaries. But any updates we make to this 16x16 sample code
will always be available here for people to use on that hardware.

If you are not a coder you can also download a Flash Download Tool to reflash a
released bin from us without needing Visual Studio Code, or Anrdroid Studio. Be aware that
if you want to write your own code for the display you will need Visual Studio Code, or 
Arduino Studio.  But the Flash download tool is perfect for those who just want to update to 
a newer release. We will add notes on how to use the Flash Download tool to our website.

==============================================================================================
NOTE if you modify the code or upload your own code to the device, we can't guarantee or 
support proper operation of the device. We can offer info on how to reflash back to our
binary, but if you do some damage to the device, or connected devices to it, we are not liable.
Any modifications you take are at your own risk. Please read the warnings in the code about
current limits imposed in the code, and do NOT modify them!
==============================================================================================

The code for this project is kept as simple as possible. Many people I talked to want to hack
around with art, but are new to the C language. So I have kept things as simple as possible.
